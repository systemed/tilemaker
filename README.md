# tilemaker

tilemaker creates vector tiles (in Mapbox Vector Tile format) from an .osm.pbf planet extract, as typically downloaded from providers like Geofabrik. It aims to be 'stack-free': you need no database and there is only one executable to install.

Vector tiles are used by many in-browser/app renderers, and can also power server-side raster rendering. They enable on-the-fly style changes and greater interactivity, while imposing less of a storage burden. tilemaker can output them to individual files, or to .mbtiles or .pmtiles tile containers.

See an example of a vector tile map produced by tilemaker at [tilemaker.org](https://tilemaker.org).

![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/systemed/tilemaker/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)

## Getting Started

We provide a ready-to-use docker image that gets you started without having to compile tilemaker from source:

1. Go to http://download.geofabrik.de/europe.html and download the `monaco-latest.osm.pbf` snapshot of OpenStreetMap

2. Run tilemaker on the OpenStreetMap snapshot to generate [Protomaps](https://protomaps.com) vector tiles:

    docker run -it --rm -v (pwd):/data ghcr.io/systemed/tilemaker:master /data/monaco-latest.osm.pbf --output /data/monaco-latest.pmtiles

3. Check out what's in the vector tiles e.g. by using the debug viewer [here](https://protomaps.github.io/PMTiles/)


## Installing

tilemaker is written in C++14. The chief dependencies are:

* Boost (latest version advised, 1.66 minimum)
* Lua (5.1 or later) or LuaJIT
* sqlite3
* shapelib
* rapidjson

Other third-party code is bundled in the include/ directory.

You can then simply install with:

    make
    sudo make install
	
For detailed installation instructions for your operating system, see [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

## Out-of-the-box setup

tilemaker comes with configuration files compatible with the popular [OpenMapTiles](https://openmaptiles.org) schema, and a demonstration map server. You'll run tilemaker to make vector tiles from your `.osm.pbf` source data. To create the tiles, run this from the tilemaker directory:

    tilemaker /path/to/your/input.osm.pbf /path/to/your/output.mbtiles

tilemaker keeps everything in RAM by default. To process large areas without running out of memory, tell it to use temporary storage on SSD:

    tilemaker /path/to/your/input.osm.pbf /path/to/your/output.mbtiles --store /path/to/your/ssd

Then, to serve your tiles using the demonstration server:

    cd server
	tilemaker-server /path/to/your/output.mbtiles

You can now navigate to http://localhost:8080/ and see your map!

## Coastline and Landcover

To include sea tiles and small-scale landcover, run

    ./get-coastline.sh
    ./get-landcover.sh

This will download coastline and landcover data; you will need around 2GB disk space.

Have a look at the coastline and landcover example in the [`resources/`](./resources) directory.

## Your own configuration

Vector tiles contain (generally thematic) 'layers'. For example, your tiles might contain river, cycleway and railway layers. It's up to you what OSM data goes into each layer. You configure this in tilemaker with two files:

* a JSON file listing each layer, and the zoom levels at which to apply it
* a Lua program that looks at each node/way's tags, and places it into layers accordingly

You can read more about these in [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

The JSON configuration and Lua processing files are specified with `--config` and `--process` respectively. Defaults are config.json and process.lua in the current directory. If there is no config.json and process.lua in the current directory, and you do not specify `--config` and `--process`, an error will result.

Read about tilemaker's runtime options in [RUNNING.md](docs/RUNNING.md).

## Why tilemaker?

You might use tilemaker if:

* You want to create vector tiles yourself, without a third-party contract
* You don't want to host/maintain a database
* You want a flexible system capable of advanced OSM tag processing
* You want to create ready-to-go tiles for offline use

But don't use tilemaker if:

* You want someone else to create and host the tiles for you
* You want continuous updates with the latest OSM data
